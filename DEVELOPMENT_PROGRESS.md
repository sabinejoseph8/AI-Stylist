# AI Stylist development progress

Updated: 10 October 2026

## Authority and sources

Sabine authorized autonomous development on 10 October 2026. Routine implementation and architecture decisions may proceed with documented assumptions. Business decisions, credentials, financial authorization, security-sensitive actions and irreversible operations still require intervention.

Read the v1.8 PRD and prioritized backlog in the AI stylist folder, the latest approved product/design specifications, technical decisions, AGENTS.md and docs/progress.md. Original artifact files are preserved. docs/development-backlog.md imports every original backlog item and tracks implementation status. Later explicit decisions refine the older artifact scope: one look at a time, USA/USD, required accounts, real shopping links at launch and affiliate revenue. Existing phase exit gates still apply.

## Completed evidence

- Task 1a planning accepted.
- Private desktop/iPhone voice and avatar reply, mouth movement and interrupt-and-end accepted; conversational resume unproven.
- Original 18-step notebook review and seven-step local connection rehearsal accepted by Sabine.
- D02 normalized catalog contract implemented, with two synthetic adapters and shared tests.
- D03 searchable internal catalog implemented with four original illustrations and non-purchasable sample products. Agent browser verification passed all-items search, Blue search, image loading and empty-state recovery.
- Phase 1d source-access/privacy desk research and X01 ASOS/FARFETCH public comparison recorded; permission and launch decisions remain open.
- Prepared a disabled extraction HTTP transport with injected simulated requests, a 32 KiB request/response limit, strict destination/content checks and cancellation of late response bodies. All 24 new checks passed; no live route or credentials were added.
- Prepared a disabled transcription socket binding: bounded input/output, send backpressure, cancellation, listener cleanup and redacted failures. Tested its complete simulated extraction/notebook chain and actual loopback WebSocket framing with a synthetic provider.
- Consolidated the simulated transports and notebook probe into one prepared session factory. External cancellation, disconnect, extraction failure and cleanup failure have focused checks.
- Connected the combined factory to the disabled private browser bridge. Seven new checks cover two turns, confirmation, late extraction, disconnect, failed cleanup, immediate provider-failure notification and provider-acknowledged readiness.
- Updated the visible local rehearsal to use the combined socket/extraction components. Implementer browser verification passed Emerald green, Blue correction, confirmation and end/clear.
- Added combined seven-field, missing/ambiguous-value and budget-correction scenarios. Confirmed-only fixture checks hold tentative notes and owned items; a spoken budget reduction invalidates a passed ticket and blocks an over-budget sample after confirmation.
- Combined browser lifecycle checks cover pagehide/visibility, delayed permission, provider failure, device loss, actual connection loss and late extraction. Fixed cleanup notification ordering and independent terminal capture release.
- docs/phase-1-readiness.md reconciles P1 evidence and the remaining live/rights/privacy gates.
- Session replacement checks isolate old extraction/provider events, reject stale render receipts and refuse a new connection after failed cleanup. Combined budget correction revokes visual and speech-frame permissions.
- Reviewed current official provider guides and recorded compatibility plus unresolved full-reference/connection checks in docs/notebook-provider-contract-review.md.
- Added a disabled private notebook server owner with 23 synthetic access, cancellation, concurrency, deadline, cleanup and partial-extraction integration checks. No legacy allowance or actual durable records are used.
- Connected the protected owner to an explicitly simulated loopback bridge. Seventeen new tests cover access, readiness, two turns, late startup, pending/failed closure, stale identity and disposal.
- Added seven protected browser lifecycle checks with synthetic devices: pagehide/visibility, late permission, pending extraction, device loss and actual loopback disconnect. Injected reservation closure is checked.
- Prepared docs/combined-notes-live-trial-plan.md with a complete future manual script and activation prerequisites; it starts no trial and grants no spending permission.
- docs/mvp.md created from approved scope and actual findings, with unresolved decisions explicit.
- 894 automated prototype checks, type checking and build last passed. The connected rehearsal is local simulation, not a live provider or network deployment.



### Protected deadlines and replacement evidence

Four additional loopback checks verify deadline expiry while closure is pending, failed closure retaining a hold without retries, startup expiry retiring a late reservation without a provider, and old extraction/provider results staying isolated from a replacement notebook. All 777 tests across 57 files, type checking and build pass. These use synthetic services and injected allowances. D21/D22, Task 1c and Phase 1 remain partial. No paid call, allowance change or deployment occurred.



### Official-schema fixture checks

Eight synthetic checks cover the documented session envelope, transcript deltas and completion events with token/duration usage metadata. Only transcript text reaches the note coordinator; metadata is not converted into preferences or confidence. Missing event/item IDs and contentless/unmapped deltas hold the session, and cancellation rejects a late completion. All 785 tests across 58 files, type checking and build pass. These fixtures establish conservative decoder behavior, not live model acceptance. Current session.updated documentation is retrieved; dedicated transcription startup and the conflicting delay descriptions remain unresolved. Task 1c and Phase 1 remain partial. No paid request, allowance change or deployment occurred.



### Separate notebook allowance preparation

Prepared a simulation-only allowance with a strict notes-only ledger, explicit bounded fixture amounts, lifetime attempt accounting and injected compare-and-swap persistence. It has no credentials, URL, RPC, initialization, amendment, automatic refund or retry. Missing/legacy/corrupt records, unresolved runs, failed writes and failed closure hold further work. Fifteen checks cover replacement adapter instances sharing an in-memory store, concurrent owners, a write succeeding before its response fails, failed closure, malformed records and an exhausted allowance blocking provider construction. No actual database or server restart was exercised. Fixture approval is not spending authorization. All 800 tests across 59 files, type checking and build pass. No remote data, nine-trial legacy history or deployment was changed; Task 1c and Phase 1 remain partial.



### Separate allowance connection integration

Six loopback checks now exercise the separate PreparedNoteAllowance through the protected browser lifecycle. Page exit during a pending write retires a late successful reservation without a provider; uncertain writes and failed closure retain holds. Pending closure blocks replacement, confirmed closure permits a fresh reservation, hidden-page capture stops, and two bridges sharing a simulated compare-and-swap store permit only one provider owner. All 806 tests across 60 files, type checking and build pass. These are synthetic persistence/provider checks, not Supabase or physical-device acceptance. The unapplied storage design and database verification gates are in docs/notebook-allowance-storage-plan.md. No remote records, allowance or deployment changed.



### Notebook allowance transition and database preparation

Implemented a shared pure validator permitting exactly one open append or one closure, preserving approval, record order and IDs. Seventeen focused checks reject amendments, removal, reopening, duplicate IDs, no-op updates and combined transitions. The cumulative prototype suite is 823 tests across 61 files, with type checking and build passing.

Prepared supabase/notebook-allowance-preparation.sql with a private table, row security, private privilege-elevating implementations and server-only invoker RPC wrappers. It neither initializes an allowance nor changes any legacy budget object. Forty-two checks passed in a pinned isolated PostgreSQL 17 container with no network or host ports: transition invariants, missing records, actual role denials, server reads/changes, stale and concurrent compare-and-swap, attempt caps and an unchanged synthetic legacy sentinel. Fixed a migration CASE-expression syntax error and changed the test sentinel comparison to semantic JSON equality. The temporary container was removed. No actual Supabase configuration, records or spending allowance changed. Remote privileges, database recovery and transport verification remain open; this is not hosted acceptance.



### Bounded notebook persistence transport

Prepared an explicitly simulated transport for only the two notebook RPC wrappers, with exact HTTPS project destination validation, 16 KiB request/response limits, strict JSON and response checks, an eight-second deadline, late-body cancellation and no default fetch, credentials, redirects, retries, initializer or legacy fallback. Forty new checks cover the boundary and timeout behavior. Six new protected-owner checks cover reservation/closure, uncertain writes, failed closure, browser departure, late responses and invalid snapshots. Existing six browser lifecycle/shared-store checks now run through this transport too. A missing synthetic capture cleanup source in the new test fixture was corrected; all 869 prototype checks across 63 files, type checking and build pass.

Prepared an unapplied rollback that refuses any initialized allowance and uses no CASCADE. Fifty isolated PostgreSQL checks now pass, including refused rollback preserving history, empty rollback removal, unchanged synthetic legacy data and reinstallation without automatic seeding. The temporary container was removed. No actual Supabase configuration, records, allowance or deployment changed. Transport calls remain injected simulations, not hosted RPC acceptance.

## Current work and dependency order

1. Preserve the implemented catalog and combined notebook discovery evidence without treating it as a full feature launch.
2. Continue independent Task 1c deterministic integration work; the combined browser/provider lifecycle is now checked.
3. Use docs/phase-1-readiness.md for remaining live evidence and dependency gates.
4. Keep source permissions, privacy and later-phase acceptance requirements open until evidenced.

## Blockers and remaining work

- Tavus audio-clear/recovery reply has not been supplied. No safe conversational resume acceptance.
- All nine provider trials are closed and reserve is zero. No further paid trial, funding or plan upgrade is authorized.
- No retailer/feed or imagery license is approved. Synthetic catalogs cannot satisfy real shoppable launch requirements.
- Customer-provider privacy terms, session recovery policy and production retention remain business/security decisions.
- Phase 1 is incomplete; full Phase 2 and later feature builds retain their documented dependencies. No customer release is ready.
- Memory site is not established. Record progress here rather than claiming a remote Memory update.

## Exact next action

All 894 prototype checks across 64 files, type checking and build pass. Fifty separate local PostgreSQL checks, eight SQL-backed TypeScript owner scenarios and fourteen SQL-backed browser scenarios pass, including a fresh Node process preserving unresolved history; the temporary isolated container was removed. The bounded persistence transport is implemented and checked through the protected owner and browser lifecycle with injected simulated requests. No actual Supabase records or legacy reservations changed.

Next exercise the internally checked candidate gate through the SQL-backed lifecycle with final extraction settlement and a second confirmed voice correction. Verify stale candidate denial, fresh candidate acceptance and queued speech cancellation in the combined owner harness. Then prepare a separate simulated saved-profile constraint source so candidate data cannot supply its own exclusions. Keep all real providers, products, hosting changes and paid trials disabled; do not alter approved customer/business decisions.

The dedicated transcription startup and conflicting delay descriptions remain unresolved live dependencies in docs/notebook-provider-contract-review.md. A real notebook trial still needs reviewed remote storage/configuration and a newly authorized amount. Do not seed/change Supabase or reuse/reset the nine closed legacy reservations. Keep providers disabled. Task 1c, Tavus recovery clarification, source/privacy decisions and Phase 1 exit remain open.

## Session handoff

The source increments and progress evidence are saved locally and committed. Live providers remain disabled for these additions. No new allowance, provider trial, retailer application or Render deployment was made. The next implementation task above needs no renewed routine-development approval. Human intervention is required later for a new paid trial allowance, the Tavus recovery reply and source/privacy launch decisions. Phase 1 remains incomplete.

## Autonomous instructions maintenance

Updated root AGENTS.md with the complete autonomous development rules, routine decision authority, escalation boundaries and mandatory DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md session handoff. Removed conflicting routine approval instructions while retaining financial/security rules and historical records. Documentation-only change; implementation next action above is unchanged.


### SQL-backed notebook owner composition

Connected the prepared TypeScript allowance, bounded persistence transport and protected owner to injected RPC responses backed by real local PostgreSQL transactions. Seven scenarios pass: normal reserve/close, fresh owners preserving consumed attempt history and exhaustion, a committed reservation with a lost acknowledgment, a separate fresh Node process holding that unresolved reservation, a committed closure with a lost acknowledgment, browser departure while reservation confirmation is pending, and concurrent owners forced to read the same snapshot before compare-and-swap. Only one competing owner constructs a synthetic provider. A lost closure acknowledgment keeps the original owner held; a fresh owner reads confirmed closure only after the synthetic provider cleanup has completed. This does not establish recovery from an unknown real provider state.

All 869 prototype tests across 63 files, type checking and build pass. The database harness additionally passes 50 SQL checks and seven TypeScript composition scenarios. Scripts are included in type checking. The harness verifies the pinned container image, no network or ports, temporary storage and no host mounts before using synthetic fixtures. It removes the container in finally. No Supabase HTTP authentication, actual database records, paid provider, spending allowance or deployment was used. D21/D22, Task 1c and Phase 1 remain partial.


### SQL-backed browser lifecycle composition

Seven additional scenarios connect the prepared browser session and lifecycle to a real loopback WebSocket bridge, protected owner, bounded persistence transport and isolated PostgreSQL transactions. They verify origin/host/authentication refusal before any database or provider work, page departure while reservation confirmation is pending, replacement blocked until verified closure, failed closure preserving an unresolved record and held slot, a lost reservation acknowledgment blocking both original and fresh bridges, hidden-page capture cleanup and note clearing, and the real eight-second persistence deadline with a late response retaining the hold. All providers and capture sources are synthetic; no actual camera, microphone, Supabase HTTP connection or paid request is used.

The first run exposed a harness cleanup assumption: an intentionally held lease remains active. Corrected fixture disposal to accept a held slot while still disposing its sockets/listeners/server, and to attempt every fixture cleanup even if another fails. The application hold behavior was correct and unchanged. The database subprocess has a bounded 60-second test deadline. The project runtime dependencies must be installed to run the loopback checks.

All 869 prototype tests across 63 files, type checking and build pass. Separately, 50 SQL checks, seven SQL-backed owner scenarios and seven SQL-backed browser scenarios pass. Temporary containers and loopback servers are removed after the checks. No remote data, allowance, legacy reservation or deployment changed. D21/D22, Task 1c and Phase 1 remain partial.


### SQL-backed partial notes and correction evidence

Three further browser/database scenarios use the actual prepared extraction adapter with injected strict GPT response fixtures. They verify two successive partial/final turns with tentative notes and explicit confirmation, a touch correction preserved through older partial and final extraction, and cancellation of pending extraction on page exit with its late response unable to restore notes. The canceled response is consumed/canceled, capture refuses subsequent frames, and the database reservation closes once after cleanup. The cumulative isolated evidence is 50 SQL checks, seven owner scenarios and ten browser scenarios. All 869 prototype tests, type checking and build pass. This is synthetic provider integration with actual loopback sockets/local SQL, not live recognition, timing, device acceptance or hosted authentication. No remote data, allowance, provider call or deployment changed; D21/D22 and Phase 1 remain partial.


### SQL-backed failure cleanup and connection review

Four more browser/database scenarios verify provider disconnect during active capture, malformed extraction, permission granted after page exit and uncertain provider cleanup. Verified local cleanup closes the reservation exactly once and clears notes; late frames/events cannot restore the session. When synthetic socket cleanup throws, the reservation stays open, no closure write is attempted and replacement remains blocked. Fixed an inferred callback return type in the new harness and added an explicit wait for browser termination before asserting its cleanup state. The cumulative evidence is 50 isolated SQL checks, seven owner scenarios and fourteen browser scenarios, plus all 869 prototype tests, type checking and build. No live devices/providers, remote records, allowance changes or deployment were used.

Rechecked official OpenAI connection documentation. The discovered intent-based cookbook is archived; the transcription-token reference is deprecated. Neither resolves current server-owned dedicated startup for the selected model. Recorded this distinction and prepared four unsent clarification questions in docs/notebook-transcription-startup-questions.md. No model/protocol change was made. D21/D22, Task 1c and Phase 1 remain partial.

## Server-owned look authorization preparation, 10 October 2026

Connected the existing synthetic LookRelease to the exact NotebookState owned by each disabled prepared server session. Its check tickets and permits stay in server memory; the notebook wire has no recommendation commands. New input revokes permission before microphone acquisition, and no new check can begin during capture, pending provider commit or final extraction. Touch corrections, shutdown, deadline and uncertain cleanup revoke display and queued speech immediately. A replacement cannot revive an earlier capability. A separate internal input-start hook preserves the existing browser message order.

Nine focused checks and one additional SQL-backed owner scenario cover these boundaries. All 878 prototype checks across 63 files, type checking and build pass. The isolated harness passes 50 SQL checks, eight owner scenarios and fourteen browser scenarios. This remains synthetic authorization preparation: a trusted checker must independently validate the exact draft against confirmed notes and saved preferences. No real candidate generator, production preference agent, speech transport, provider call, remote database change or deployment is included. D21/D22/D26 and Phase 1 remain partial.

## Internally checked synthetic candidates, 10 October 2026

The disabled server owner now captures a bounded immutable candidate and derives its sample display/speech description from the same checked attributes. Its completion method runs checkFixture against the authoritative notebook itself; callers cannot supply a passed result. Exact tickets, revision checks and session readiness still apply. Malformed replacement data revokes the previous sample. Exclusions are copied/frozen; arbitrary description fields are rejected. The narrow checker holds missing or tentative required fields, unknown wardrobe/season matching, conflicting colors/style/occasion/look type, and unverified or excessive prices. Its candidate exclusions are synthetic inputs, not a connection to persisted customer preferences.

Sixteen additional focused checks bring the prototype suite to 894 across 64 files; type checking and build pass. The isolated database evidence remains 50 SQL checks, eight owner scenarios and fourteen browser scenarios, with the owner scenario now using internal candidate validation. No real product source, saved-profile preference agent, live speech, provider activation, remote change or deployment is included. D26 has independent discovery preparation only; its R1 dependencies and acceptance remain open.

## Project memory review, 10 October 2026

Reviewed all five project memory files: product, design, technical specification, phased progress and MVP. Refreshed current checkpoints and stale planning/device/publication claims while preserving approved product/design v1.0, requirements, tokens, historical evidence and all phase gates. Confirmed 894 prototype checks and 50 SQL + 8 owner + 14 browser checks as the latest previously completed evidence; no tests were rerun for this documentation-only update. The exact next implementation action and blockers above remain current. Original v1.8 documents and private configuration were untouched. Memory site is still not established.
