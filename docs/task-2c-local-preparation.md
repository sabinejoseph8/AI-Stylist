# Task 2c local account preparation

Approved by Sabine on 11 October 2026 while Phase 1 remains open. Local interfaces and simulated tests only. No hosted configuration, real sign-ins, new credentials, paid calls or deployment.

## Implementation order

1. Add a provider-independent account-flow controller with injected account operations and a clear signed-out state. Credentials are passed only for the requested operation, never included in snapshots or logs.
2. Cover required email/password, confirmation-required registration and generic recovery acknowledgment. Do not infer account existence from recovery replies or treat registration as completed authentication.
3. Prepare Google and Apple pending/cancel/failure flows. Invalidate stale replies after navigation, a new attempt or sign-out. No automatic merging of unverified identities.
4. Prepare server-side verified identity, cookie, callback, origin and session-revocation boundaries. Browser claims alone never authorize styling or personal-data access.
5. Add local account screens using approved design tokens with an explicit simulated-mode explanation. Keep production styling gated while no actual account verification exists.
6. Run focused automated checks and a local visual review before claiming local UI acceptance.

## Acceptance boundaries

A successful simulated response proves a controller branch only. Actual email confirmation/delivery, recovery links, Google/Apple credentials and provider setup, identity linking, hosted callback allowlists, sign-out/token revocation and physical-device sign-in remain unverified. Those actions require their applicable approvals and Sabine's account steps. Do not enable account features in the hosted prototype under this exception.


## Local account-flow controller

Added a disconnected UI controller with injected provider operations, generation fencing, cancellation and a bounded deadline. It covers email/password, confirmation-required registration, generic recovery acknowledgment, Google/Apple pending/canceled states and immediate local sign-out. Failed remote sign-out is explicitly unconfirmed. Snapshots contain no passwords, email addresses, session tokens or raw provider errors. Canceled-before-dispatch operations never invoke the provider; late replies cannot restore local identity. Browser state is not server authorization.

All 223 foundation tests across 18 files, type checking and build pass. These eight new controller checks use synthetic responses; email delivery, actual OAuth, server tokens, cookies, callback/recovery validation and remote revocation are not implemented. The controller is not yet displayed in the foundation UI. Task 2c remains in progress and local-only.


## Local public signing-key transport

Prepared a disconnected fixed-project JWKS resolver using jose and injected fetch. Only the configured HTTPS Supabase endpoint is fetched, never a token-supplied URL. Requests refuse redirects, omit credentials and bound response time to five seconds, body size to 64 KiB and key count to 32. Private/symmetric key material is refused. Public keys expire after ten minutes; refresh attempts have a thirty-second cooldown. Unknown signing keys can trigger one allowed refresh, with concurrent callers sharing the request. A response deadline also covers injected transports that ignore cancellation; their pending operation stays retained so repeated calls cannot launch unlimited requests. Production native fetch is expected to honor abort; a non-cooperative injected operation can leave this resolver unavailable until it settles. No automatic retries or stale-cache fallback after expiration.

All 240 foundation tests across 21 files, type checking and build pass. Generated ES256 keys verify cryptographically through simulated HTTP responses. Rotation, unknown-key request storms, private keys, excessive response bodies, unsupported algorithms, ignored cancellation and stalled bodies are checked. No live JWKS request, actual signing configuration inspection or hosted account activation occurred. Cookie/origin and OAuth/recovery callback boundaries remain next.
